### Compilation:
* For windows: open the solution file with visual studio and compile.
* For linux: open the terminal in the repo's directory and run `make`.

#### Note
The GUI and console files are loaded dynamically, so the terminal stays open for both of them. If you want a fully GUI/Console version you'll need to change the main file to load one of them and make a standalone executable.
